Passerelle
==========

Passerelle, formerly known as "Saitek Flight Panels for Lua", is a Lua module to control your gaming devices. This module has been design to allow the Saitek [Flight Instrument Panel](http://www.saitek.com/uk/prod/fip.html) (FIP) device and [X52 Pro](http://www.saitek.com/uk/prod/x52pro.html) flight stick to be controlled from Lua.

Back in 2011, the motivation was to allow Flight Simulator 2004 users to use the FIP with the simulator using Pete Dowson's [FSUIPC](http://www.schiratti.com/dowson.html) and its Lua scripting capabilities. This module can now be used in a wide range of games and flight simulators integrating a Lua scripting engine.
